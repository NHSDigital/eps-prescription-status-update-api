# EPS Prescription Status Update API

![Build](https://github.com/NHSDigital/eps-prescription-status-update-api/workflows/release/badge.svg?branch=main)

This is the AWS layer that provides an API for EPS Prescription Status Update.

- `packages/specification/` This [Open API Specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) describes the endpoints, methods and messages.
- `scripts/` Utilities helpful to developers of this specification.
- `.devcontainer` Contains a dockerfile and vscode devcontainer definition.
- `.github` Contains github workflows that are used for building and deploying from pull requests and releases.
- `.vscode` Contains vscode workspace file.

Consumers of the API will find developer documentation on the [NHS Digital Developer Hub](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue).

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome from anyone, providing that they conform to the [guidelines for contribution](https://github.com/NHSDigital//eps-prescription-status-update-api/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [community code of conduct](https://github.com/NHSDigital//eps-prescription-status-update-api/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Licensing

This code is dual licensed under the MIT license and the OGL (Open Government License). Any new work added to this repository must conform to the conditions of these licenses. In particular this means that this project may not depend on GPL-licensed or AGPL-licensed libraries, as these would violate the terms of those libraries' licenses.

## Development

It is recommended that you use visual studio code and a devcontainer as this will install all necessary components and correct versions of tools and languages.  
See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers for details on how to set this up on your host machine.  
There is also a workspace file in .vscode that should be opened once you have started the devcontainer. The workspace file can also be opened outside of a devcontainer if you wish.  
The project uses [SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) to develop and deploy the APIs and associated resources.

All commits must be made using [signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).

Once the steps at the link above have been completed. Add to your ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf as below:

```
use-agent
pinentry-mode loopback
```

and to your ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf as below:

```
allow-loopback-pinentry
```

As described here:

You will need to create the files, if they do not already exist.
This will ensure that your VSCode bash terminal prompts you for your GPG key password.

You can cache the gpg key passphrase by following instructions at https://superuser.com/questions/624343/keep-gnupg-credentials-cached-for-entire-user-session

### CI Setup

The GitHub Actions require a secret to exist on the repo called "SONAR_TOKEN".
This can be obtained from [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/)
as described [here](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/user-guide/user-account/generating-and-using-tokens/).
You will need the "Execute Analysis" permission for the project (NHSDigital_eps-prescription-status-update-api) in order for the token to work.

### Pre-commit hooks

Some pre-commit hooks are installed as part of the install above, to run basic lint checks and ensure you can't accidentally commit invalid changes.
The pre-commit hook uses python package pre-commit and is configured in the file .pre-commit-config.yaml.
A combination of these checks are also run in CI.

### Make commands

There are `make` commands that are run as part of the CI pipeline and help alias some functionality during development.

#### Install targets

- `install-node` Installs node dependencies
- `install-python` Installs python dependencies
- `install-hooks` Installs git pre commit hooks
- `install` Runs all install targets

#### Build targets

- `build-specification` Builds the specification component

#### Clean and deep-clean targets

- `clean` Clears up any files that have been generated by building or testing locally.
- `deep-clean` Runs clean target and also removes any node_modules and python libraries installed locally.

#### Linting targets

- `lint` Runs lint for all code

#### Publish targets
- `publish` Outputs the specification as a **single file** into the `build/` directory. This is used when uploading to Apigee, which requires the spec as a single file.

#### Check licenses

- `check-licenses` Checks licenses for all packages used - calls check-licenses-node, check-licenses-python
- `check-licenses-node` Checks licenses for all node code
- `check-licenses-python` Checks licenses for all python code
