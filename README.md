## Introduction!

This is the AWS layer that provides an API for EPS Prescription Status Update.

- `packages/updatePrescriptionStatus/` Handles updating prescription status for the root endpoint.
- `packages/sandbox` A sandbox endpoint returning an example response.
- `packages/specification/` This [Open API Specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) describes the endpoints, methods and messages.
- `packages/statusLambda/` Returns the status of the updatePrescriptionStatus endpoint
- `packages/capabilityStatement/` Returns a static capability statement.
- `packages/cpsuLambda` Handles updating prescription status using a custom format.
- `packages/nhsNotifyLambda` Handles sending prescription notifications to the NHS notify service.
- `scripts/` Utilities helpful to developers of this specification.
- `postman/` Postman collections to call the APIs. Documentation on how to use them are in the collections.
- `SAMtemplates/` Contains the SAM templates used to define the stacks.
- `.devcontainer` Contains a dockerfile and vscode devcontainer definition.
- `.github` Contains github workflows that are used for building and deploying from pull requests and releases.
- `.vscode` Contains vscode workspace file.
- `.releaserc` semantic-release config file

Consumers of the API will find developer documentation on the [NHS Digital Developer Hub](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue).

## Database Backups (LOOK HERE IF YOU ARE PANICKING)

Stacks deployed to AWS use a DynamoDB database for data persistence, and this is configured to use Point In Time Recovery ([PITR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Point-in-time-recovery.html)). This allows the database to be rolled back to a previous state, in cases where the present state of the database is unwholesome. Backups are (at the time of writing) persisted for 35 days, or 5 calendar weeks. For instructions on how to roll back the database table, please refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/pointintimerecovery_restores.html). The console version of the instructions is likely to be the one used.

Note that backups are "restored" as new tables, and cannot overwrite the existing one - the SAM template will need to be updated to use the new table. In addition, the newly created table will not have PITR enabled by default. Any recovery strategy requiring the backups must be cognizant of these quirks.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome from anyone, providing that they conform to the [guidelines for contribution](https://github.com/NHSDigital//eps-prescription-status-update-api/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [community code of conduct](https://github.com/NHSDigital//eps-prescription-status-update-api/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Licensing

This code is dual licensed under the MIT license and the OGL (Open Government License). Any new work added to this repository must conform to the conditions of these licenses. In particular this means that this project may not depend on GPL-licensed or AGPL-licensed libraries, as these would violate the terms of those libraries' licenses.

The contents of this repository are protected by Crown Copyright (C).

## Development

It is recommended that you use visual studio code and a devcontainer as this will install all necessary components and correct versions of tools and languages.  
See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers for details on how to set this up on your host machine.  
There is also a workspace file in .vscode that should be opened once you have started the devcontainer. The workspace file can also be opened outside of a devcontainer if you wish.  
The project uses [SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) to develop and deploy the APIs and associated resources.

All commits must be made using [signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).

Once the steps at the link above have been completed. Add to your ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf as below:

```
use-agent
pinentry-mode loopback
```

and to your ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf as below:

```
allow-loopback-pinentry
```

As described here:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/59170001

You will need to create the files, if they do not already exist.
This will ensure that your VSCode bash terminal prompts you for your GPG key password.

You can cache the gpg key passphrase by following instructions at https://superuser.com/questions/624343/keep-gnupg-credentials-cached-for-entire-user-session

### CI Setup

The GitHub Actions require a secret to exist on the repo called "SONAR_TOKEN".
This can be obtained from [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/)
as described [here](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/user-guide/user-account/generating-and-using-tokens/).
You will need the "Execute Analysis" permission for the project (NHSDigital_eps-prescription-status-update-api) in order for the token to work.

### Continuous deployment for testing

You can run the following command to deploy the code to AWS for testing

```
make sam-sync
```

This will take a few minutes to deploy - you will see something like this when deployment finishes

```

Stack creation succeeded. Sync infra completed.
```

Note - the command will keep running and should not be stopped.
You can now call this api.

```
curl -X POST https://${stack_name}.dev.eps.national.nhs.uk/
```

You can also use the AWS vscode extension to invoke the API or lambda directly

Any code changes you make are automatically uploaded to AWS while `make sam-sync` is running allowing you to quickly test any changes you make

### Pre-commit hooks

Some pre-commit hooks are installed as part of the install above, to run basic lint checks and ensure you can't accidentally commit invalid changes.
The pre-commit hook uses python package pre-commit and is configured in the file .pre-commit-config.yaml.
A combination of these checks are also run in CI.

### Make commands

There are `make` commands that are run as part of the CI pipeline and help alias some functionality during development.

#### Install targets

- `install-python` Installs python dependencies
- `install-hooks` Installs git pre commit hooks
- `install` Runs all install targets

#### SAM targets

These are used to do common commands

- `sam-build` Prepares the lambdas and SAM definition file to be used in subsequent steps.
- `sam-run-local` Runs the API and lambdas locally.
- `sam-sync` Sync the API and lambda to AWS. This keeps running and automatically uploads any changes to lambda code made locally. Needs AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE and stack_name environment variables set.
- `sam-deploy` Deploys the compiled SAM template from sam-build to AWS. Needs AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE and stack_name environment variables set.
- `sam-delete` Deletes the deployed SAM cloud formation stack and associated resources. Needs AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE and stack_name environment variables set.

### Github pages

Github pages is used to display deployment information. The source for github pages is in the gh-pages branch.  
As part of the ci and release workflows, the release tag (either the short commit SHA or release tag) is appended to \_data/{environment}\_deployments.csv so we have a history of releases and replaced in \_data/{environment}\_latest.csv so we now what the latest released version is.  
There are different makefile targets in this branch. These are

- `run-jekyll` - runs the site locally so changes can be previewed during development
- `sync-main` - syncs common files from main branch to gh-pages branch. You must commit and push after running this
- `install-python` installs python dependencies
- `install-hooks` installs git pre commit hooks
- `install-node` installs node dependencies
- `install-jekyll` installs dependencies to be able to run jekyll locally
- `install` runs all install targets
