    ## Overview
    The Prescription Status Update API allows dispensing suppliers to push status information about electronic prescriptions to patients on a national scale via the NHS App (and potential other third parties in the future).
    This includes letting patients know when their prescription is ready to collect.
    The overall aim of the service is to reduce burden to front line NHS services by reducing the number of routine patient queries about their prescriptions.
    You can:
    * Enable patients to know when their prescription is ready
    * Enable dispensing suppliers to push status information about electronic prescriptions
    ## Who can use this API
    The Prescription Status Update API is intended for NHS England internal use only; however, the specification of the data stores will be required by dispensing suppliers so they can provide and push the information required to a central NHS data store.
    ## Related APIs
    The following APIs are related to the "Prescription Status Update" API:
    * [Electronic Prescriptions Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/electronic-prescription-service-fhir): the national service for creating and dispensing prescriptions across health and social care.
    * [Prescriptions for Patients](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/prescriptions-for-patients): the national service to retrieve prescriptions data for individual patients from the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS), for use in patient-facing applications.
    ## API Status and Roadmap
    This API is [in development](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses), meaning the API will soon be available for testing via a sandbox service or an integration environment - but we expect to make breaking changes based on developer feedback.
    ## Service Level
    This API is a platinum service, meaning it is operational and supported 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
    For more details see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).
    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).
    It conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/).
    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which are built against FHIR UK Core, specifically [UK Core STU3 (v0.0.9)](https://simplifier.net/HL7FHIRUKCoreR4/).
    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API. The API only supports POST requests containing FHIR transactions.
    FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.
    These rules mean:
    * resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/Bundle` not `/bundle`
    * array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines
    * data items that are country specific and not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object
    There are [libraries and software development kits](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) available to help with FHIR API integration.
    ## Network Access
    This API is available on the internet.
    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).
    ## Security and Authorisation
    This API only supports [application-restricted access](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis), meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.
    ### Application-restricted Access
    The end user could be:
    * a healthcare worker - in which case you must ensure they are authenticated and suitably authorised locally
    * not present at all - for example as part of a back end process to check NHS numbers for data flowing from one system to another
    To use this access mode, use the following security pattern:
    * [Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication)
    ### Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not.
    They are usually in the range:
    * 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    * 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    * 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server
    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.

    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):
    * is for early developer testing
    * only covers a limited set of scenarios
    * is stateless, so it does not actually persist any updates
    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation
    For details of sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our "Try this API" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.
    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):
    * is for formal integration testing
    * is stateful, so persists updates
    * includes authorisation, with [smartcard](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) and non-smartcard options
    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).
    ## Onboarding
    All dispenser suppliers are being asked to integrate with this new service.

        ## This endpoint is only available in PTL environments
        ## Overview
        This returns prescription status updates created by the authorized application. The result can be filtered by a combination of odscode, nhsnumber or prescription id.   

        A maximum of 15 results is returned. If more results are available, then headers LastEvaluatedKey-PrescriptionID and LastEvaluatedKey-TaskID are returned in the result. These values should be used in a subsequent request in the headers ExclusiveStartKey-PrescriptionID and ExclusiveStartKey-TaskID.

        Note that it is possible that less than 15 results are returned even when more are available. This is a feature of the database and filtering method being used. At least 5 results will be returned, if available.
