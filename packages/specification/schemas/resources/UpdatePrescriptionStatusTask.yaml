    description: "The tracking status for the prescription id. 'With Pharmacy' status updates must be sent for each item in the prescription when the prescription is downloaded from EPS. This is required because not all pharmacies currently support patient prescription tracking. The 'With Pharmacy' status is used as an indicator that the prescription has been downloaded by a pharmacy that does support patient prescription tracking. The 'ready to collect' or 'ready to collect - partial' status updates must only be submitted when the prescription item is ready for the patient to collect, as this may prompt the patient to call into the pharmacy for collection. When the patient has received the prescription item or there are no more actions for the patient, the status value could be 'Collected' or 'Dispatched'. The dispensing system may update the prescription item status with any of the following values to correct a status update which has been made in error or where the status has since reverted: 'With Pharmacy', 'Ready to collect', 'Collected' or 'Dispatched'."
